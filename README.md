# COMP3000-WeighBridge_Wizard
Final year project for UoP of a web-app for weighbridge operations designed with a user-centric approach

This readMe will be updated in future but I hope to cover key aspects:

-A smooth clean UI that is intuitive and runs with react on a virtual DOM
-Help features to teach new users how to use the software and conduct weighbridge operations
-Accessibility options such as font changing, high contrast mode, colour blind mode etc
-An API that enables the App to work with a relational database

Gold Plating goals (not essential but ideal to achieve)
-An AI registration detection from the webcam that assists users to fill in forms
-An interactive tutorial to enable new users to walk through a simulated processing of a truck
